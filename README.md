# real-time-anomaly-detection-system-for-financial-transactions
The goal of this project is to build a real-time anomaly detection system for financial transactions related to government welfare schemes. The system uses a deep learning model to identify suspicious patterns that might indicate fraud and presents the findings on an interactive dashboard for auditors.
